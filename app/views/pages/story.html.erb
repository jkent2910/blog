<h2 id="story"> Regardless of whether or not you choose to read the very long or long version, both include a lot of personal details about my past.  I decided to share these things to make this blog real.  So often I read blogs about personal finance (or whatever topic) and it's hard to really "connect" with the writer.  I don't want this blog to be that way.  I hope that by telling my story and background that readers can relate and feel like they're reading a friend's blog instead of a person they've (maybe) never met.  </h2><br /><br />

<p id="short">
I am currently 26 years old <br /><br />
I grew up in a middle class family in Iowa <br /><br />
I was a horrible High School student (at first.)  I had a 1.9 GPA after my Freshman year.  <br /><br />
I battled depression.  I experimented with drugs and alcohol.  I was a victim of sexual abuse.  <br /><br /> 
A teacher took me under his wing.  I focused.  Started to get my grades up.  <br /><br />
Without ever visiting campus (or the state), I accepted admission to Georgia Tech in Atlanta.   <br /><br /> 
Being smart was cool.  People were ultra-focused.  <br /><br /> 
I got involved on-campus and off-campus while running side-hustles.  I was happier than I had ever been.  <br /><br /> 
I suffered what was later diagnosed as a heart tachycardia.  I started having really bad panic and anxiety attacks.  <br /><br /> 
I left Georgia Tech after two and a half years, hoping to come back after the summer.  I never returned.  <br /><br /> 
I finished up a degree in Business Management but stayed in school part-time taking Computer Science courses while I worked at various software/developer jobs.  <br /><br /> 
Not liking sitting in front of a computer all day, I started applying elsewhere.  <br /><br /> 
I accepted a position at Principal Financial Group in Des Moines, even though I had multiple (and higher paying) offers.  <br /><br /> 
I was in a serious relationship.  I was working extremely hard at my job.  I started to struggle with bulimia.  <br /><br /> 
It took me a long time to finally get over my eating disorder.  I made some other big changes, too.  I ended an engagement.  I transferred to a new role at work.  <br /><br /> 
Now, it's 2015.  I own two rental properties.  I also have two dogs.  I am slowly but surely on my way to finding health and happiness.  <br /><br /> 
I have a passion for helping others and making a difference.  I hope that through my blog I can help you become more financially secure.  <br /><br /> 
And I hope that by sharing my story, you have more confidence that you can do anything you put your mind to.  <br /><br /> 
Don't feel ashamed or embarrassed by what has happened in your past - we all make mistakes.  <br /><br /> 
Instead of continuing to try and cover up what you're embarrassed of, make the choice to do better today.  Not tomorrow -- today.<br /><br/>

Please feel free to e-mail me - I would love to hear from you!  And please interact with my blog posts as I will read and respond to all comments!  :)  <br /> </p>

<p id="long">As of writing this, I am 26 years old living in Des Moines, Iowa.  I was born in South (or what I used to say when I was younger when I couldn't remember, the "good" part of) Korea.  <br /><br/>

I was adopted when I was a baby, but have never really felt like an adopted child.  My mom and dad are my parents, and my only parents in my mind (even though they often threatened to send me back to Korea to eat kim-chi the rest of my life when I was mouthing off.)  Love you, mom and dad!  <br /><br/>

I grew up in a middle-class suburban family where jocks ruled the school and band geeks were band geeks.  So, pretty traditional stuff, although it took me about 13 years of life before I realized we were middle class and not below the poverty line -- more on that later.  <br /><br/>

Have you ever tried to recall your past as if you were in one of those dreams where you are having an out of body experience?  I think about my days in middle and high school like that a lot.  Like I'm observing myself at 13 or 14 with my 26 year old mind.  It's hard to reconcile.  Who WAS that person?!  <br /><br/>

Most people are shocked to hear that after my freshman year of high school, I touted a 1.9 GPA including a D in English for plagiarizing a paper because I refused to watch West Side Story.  By that time I had dabbled a bit with alcohol (mainly Five O' Clock vodka or Smirnoff Ice... classy stuff), took a puff of what was claimed to be weed, although it could have very well been Oregano, and tried to get high from huffing paints and other crap like that.  See what I mean why I say it's hard to reconcile?  Now I rarely drink, and have hypochondria so bad that I would never touch an illegal drug.<br /><br/>

I don't really have an excuse as to why I would use drugs or alcohol.  My parents were good parents.  I was provided for.  When I do try to come up with some intelligent reason for my destructive and stupid behavior, I can only really point to the fact that I needed challenge in my life.  My brain needs to be stimulated, or I just get bored and frustrated.  I remember in grade school my Mom would always tell me "3rd grade is SO much harder than 2nd" or whatever the next grade was.  I think by the time I got to 7th grade, I realized I wasn't learning anything, I just threw in the towel and decided to do nothing.  Which led to depression.  I went through probably a good year of cutting myself.  My parents tried to make me go to counseling, but I would just sit on the couch silently so it never really did any good.  <br /><br/>

In 10th grade I was a victim of sexual abuse.  I don't want to go into specifics, but it was a complicated moment of my life that I'm still dealing with today.  If there ever was a pivotal moment in my life, that was it.  I guess I just decided it was time to do better.  To focus.  Make something of myself so I could leave and get away from everything.  I was lucky enough to have a teacher that took me under his wing and made me reach potential that I didn't even know I was capable of.  I'd tell him that I was horrible in math.  He'd tell me he didn't believe me.  I'd get a bad grade on a test.  He'd call me out and ask me why.  I couldn't give the excuse of I wasn't smart enough.  He wouldn't let me.  <br /><br/>

I set my sights on turning things around, and I did the best that I could.  I loaded up with AP and college classes and got my GPA to a respectable number.  I did fairly well on the ACT and was admitted into Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.  I had never been to Atlanta before.  Actually, I had never been to the state of Georgia before.  So, without ever visiting campus or the state the college resided in, I sent in my acceptance letter and headed off to the big city.  <br /><br/>

I cried the entire first night on-campus.  I asked myself what the hell I had done, and what I was doing in the middle of a big city where I knew absolutely no one.  I have always been an introvert, so going out and meeting new people wasn't really my forte.  But I stuck it out.  After a week or so, I had made some friends and was finding my way around campus OK.  One night I was walking through the middle of campus with all of the city lights lit up around me.  I just looked up at the sky and thought - "this is why you came here.  To do something big."  <br /><br/>

When you're a Freshman at Tech, you learn a couple of things right away.  <br />
#1 - To Hell with Georgia.  <br />
#2 - Just because you're smart, doesn't mean you'll make it here. <br /><br/>

College at Tech is much different from the stories I heard from my High School friends that went to other state colleges or the like.  No one partied during the week.  Seriously, no one.  The library was "the spot" at pretty much all times.  Yes, people partied and drank on the weekends, and there was actually a really nice on-campus service that you could call if you needed a lift and were too drunk to find your way back to your dorm.  The theory around Tech was that the campus police were pretty lenient on underage drinking because those that drank too much didn't survive more than one or two semesters.  It was the "survival of the fittest" of sorts. <br /><br/>

My experience at Tech prepared me to be a professional in the Corporate world.  I got involved in a number of student organizations, and even founded my own with a grant I won - The Paw Place - which was Tech's first animal welfare student org.  To hold a leadership position in any one of Tech's student organizations required you to go through a rigorous and intense interview process.  I mean, seriously, I went through more intimidating and difficult interviews to be the "Director of Publicity" for Tech Beautification Day than any post-college job interview.  It was like the real world.  There were certain student organizations that were led by the elite - the best of the best on-campus.  Then there were the "starter" organizations that you could probably get a leadership position in if you interviewed well and could show your passion.  It would always help if you knew someone already involved with the organization to vouch for you.  <br /><br/>

Being a leader of a student organization - especially at Tech - is tough.  Like the real world, there is a reputation to uphold.  You must get results.  And, unlike a real company with employees who are getting paid for work, you are leading volunteers.  People who choose to give you their time, and can choose not to give you their time very easily.  It was through these experiences that I learned the power of influence.  I needed to keep volunteers motivated, engaged, and happy to keep my "job" as a leader of a student organization.  <br /><br/>

That's what I loved most about Tech.  The people.  The culture.  You never had to ask anyone what their priorities were.  School came first.  Social life second.  People were doing big things and had even bigger dreams.  You didn't have to deal with people in group projects not pulling their weight.  Instead you had to deal with fighting to be the project lead and making sure your contribution was as good as everyone else's. <br /><br/>

In addition to being a part of student organizations, I also worked at least 20 hours/week every semester in some sort of internship or Co-Op.  A couple of semesters it was 40+.  I worked because I felt I had to - paying out of state tuition was depleting my college fund rather quickly - but I also worked because I enjoyed it.  I liked understanding business, being able to put my studies to practical use, and learning from people who had seemed to have "made it" in my 19-year old eyes.<br /><br/>

Thinking back on it, I guess it was around this time that I started to "become" an entrepreneur.  My boyfriend at the time had his own LLC (which totally amazed me) and did a lot of independent contracting.  He developed his own games and sold them to the popular websites.  He became pretty well-known in the area and was frequently getting requests for development work.  But, also being a Tech student, he just didn't have the capacity to do it all.  So, we started to find our own contractors and basically match the jobs we were getting in with someone on our "list."  We would funnel the work to them to do while I would be the one interacting with the end client.  The developer would get paid, and we'd take a chunk of it.  I'm sure we weren't following all of the legal requirements to do these sorts of transactions, but at the time, we just thought it was an easy way to make some extra money.<br /><br/>

The reason I'm telling you all of this has a purpose, I promise.  Truth is, I was extremely happy during this part of my life.  I felt like I had it all, and the world was at my fingertips.  I was winning awards on-campus for being a "Visionary Student Leader" and getting praise and job-offers from the companies I was working at while going to school.  People would always ask me, "how do you do it all?" when they found out everything that I was doing.  And I suppose, there became a point where it was just too much for my body to handle.  I wasn't sleeping much, I was on the go 24-7, and I wasn't exercising or eating healthy. <br /><br/>
I was sitting at my desk at Southern Company one afternoon when I felt a funny feeling.  It is hard to describe or explain, but I just remember my vision going blurry and feeling my heartbeat start racing.  And when I say racing, I mean, really fast.  I put my fingers on my neck to feel my pulse and it was going so fast I couldn't count.  I went down to the nursing station in a panic.  The nurse took my blood pressure and it was through the roof.  She could tell something was wrong and immediately called the ambulance.  I thought I was dying.<br /><br/>

The ambulance came and picked me up.  The EMT's hooked me up to a bunch of machines in the back of the ambulance and put one of those masks over my nose and mouth so I could breathe.  All I could think about was my mom and dad.  That I didn't get to say goodbye.  I saw their faces when they got the call telling them their daughter had died.  It was scary as hell.  The weird thing was, I guess I had always thought when I was about to die, that I would be worried about everything I didn't get to do in life.  That I'd be sad I never traveled to Paris or whatever.  But all that I could think about were those close to me, and how I felt like I was letting them down.  I wanted to be able to tell them that I WASN'T thinking about what I could have done.  That I was at peace with dying, and that they shouldn't mourn for me.  But I wasn't going to get to tell them that.  It was a horrible feeling.  <br /><br/>

The good news is that I wasn't dying.  I would later find out that I likely suffered from a heart tachycardia which basically means a really fast heart rate that can be set on by a number of factors.  It is usually non-life threatening and I may have another tomorrow, or not have one the rest of my life.  So, not that big of a deal, right? <br /><br/>

Well, the months between having the tachycardia and actually having a doctor finally diagnose me with that were the hardest months of my life.  The doctors were doing their job and trying to rule out other causes, but that made me become a paranoid freak.  I was wearing a heart monitor 24-7, had a variety of heart-related tests and was just a complete mess.  I was afraid to be alone because I thought I might die.  I developed severe acid reflux which also took awhile to diagnose that gave me a wonderful burning sensation in my chest - further evidence towards my "I have a major heart problem" hypothesis.  <br /><br/>

I tried to stick it out in Atlanta by myself but after going to the ER two times for what really were extreme panic-attacks (of course at the time I thought I was dying), my Dad flew down to Atlanta to be with me and hopefully calm me down.  Throughout the whole ordeal, I didn't want to leave.  I didn't want to leave Tech.  My friends were here now.  I had fallen in love with the city.  I had a boyfriend.  I had a job.  This is where my home was now.<br /><br/>

My parents convinced me to come home for "just the summer" to get well and figure everything out.  But, I never made it back.  Fear crept in.  I now associated Atlanta with bad thoughts and feelings of anxiety.  I started to get anxious just thinking about being back there, as much as I knew deep down that's where I wanted to be.  I rationalized my decision to transfer from Tech by the fact that I wouldn't have to take out any student loans (which I likely would have had to do if I stayed at Tech) and could graduate with a degree in three years.<br /><br/>

So that's what I did.  I went to Mount Mercy University because they took all of my credits, no questions asked.  They even gave me credit for the community college courses I took in high school that Tech wouldn't transfer.  I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in two semesters and before my 21st birthday.  By this time I had started to get interested in computers and programming.  I've always been drawn to things I suck at or don't understand.  I didn't like the feeling of "not knowing" - when I had friends that could write these computer programs to do cool stuff, I wanted to be able to do it, too.  Tech had required all undergraduates, regardless of degree, to take several Computer Science courses so I had learned the basics of Python, Java, and some of the front-end stuff like HTML/CSS and Javascript.  So even though I had graduated, I stuck around and took a part-time schedule filled with math and CS courses with the thought of becoming a software developer.  <br /><br/>

I convinced a small web development firm to take me on for around $35,000/year while I continued to work towards the degree.  I developed websites utilizing ASP.NET.  I hated it.  I couldn't stand sitting and staring at my computer screen all day.  Even worse, it pissed me off every time I "wasted" 30 minutes debugging something that turned out to be a stupid syntax error.  The culture wasn't really my cup of tea, either, so I left that company after only 4-5 months and took an hourly Co-Op position at Rockwell Collins doing Software Engineering.  You would have thought I would have seen the writing on the wall from the web development role, but I didn't.  So I learned that C/ADA development is even more boring.  At least for me.  I stuck it out until I graduated again, and by then had figured out I still had access to the Georgia Tech career portal.  <br /><br/>

I was able to apply to positions at companies all across the nation.  I made it clear in my resume (or cover letter) that I did not graduate from Tech but had attended for the majority of my collegiate career and of course included all of my student involvement and work experience from Atlanta.  Most of the companies were more than happy to let me interview, but there were a couple that said absolutely not due to the fact I didn't have a piece of paper with Georgia Tech on it.  <br /><br/>

I made it to the final round for nearly every company I applied - Hewlett Packard, Pepsico, Citigroup, GEICO, Bank of America - to name a few.  I flew around the country interviewing and was pleased to get offers from over 50% by the time I was done.  It really came down to Bank of America in Charlotte, North Carolina and Principal Financial Group in Des Moines.  Bank of America offered me a role in their "Technology Associate Program" with a starting salary of $65,000 with a $15,000 signing bonus.  They told me they'd hook me up with everything I needed to have an at-home office, and that most people just came into work on Friday's.  In 2010, that was pretty darn good.  The role at Principal was in their "Leadership Development Program" for $50,000 and no bonus.  I won't lie, I did try to negotiate the salary, but didn't have any success.  I liked the Principal campus and they sold the Program really well.  My boyfriend at the time had been working in Iowa City and I knew it would difficult to keep a long distance relationship going.  Ultimately, I made the decision to take the job at Principal.  If I had learned anything from my health scare in Atlanta, it was that friends and family are what's truly important.  When you're about to die - that is what you think about - not your material belongings or whether or not you have a high paying job.  So I wanted to stay closer to my family, and I liked the fact that the Program at Principal gave me the opportunity to rotate through different areas and roles every 6-12 months.  My mom always says I'm like a light switch -- I'm on or I'm off.  I go hard at something and then I get really bored.  I figured rotating around would help keep my switch on.  <br /><br/>

It's 2015 and I've been at Principal for almost five years.  It seems crazy to say that - the time has gone by so fast.  I've met some amazing people here and had some awesome opportunities that I'm extremely thankful for.  For a 26 year old young professional, I've been pretty darn blessed.  When I started at Principal, I focused 125% at work, being the absolute best I could be, and really just started to "settle down" into traditional life -- my boyfriend and I got engaged, we bought a bigger house, we got a membership at a country club -- perfect, right?  <br /><br/>

I started to struggle with bulimia sometime in 2011.  It started rather innocently.  I don't tolerate alcohol, especially wine, very well but of course I do like to drink every now and then.  One night after a nice dinner out and too much wine, I ended up having to vomit.  Now, I had eaten a LOT that night - appetizer, entree, dessert.  I remember being surprised the next morning that I hadn't gained any weight - I had actually LOST a pound.  I started to use the wine as an excuse.  I'd go out to dinner and drink a lot of wine to the point where I knew I'd have to vomit, but also knew deep down that I was doing it on purpose to not gain any weight. <br /><br/>

I honestly can't remember how it changed from that to becoming a full on habit of binging and purging.  I've always watched my what I eat and my weight but never taken it as far as making myself throw up.  It is quite disgusting to even think, or write about now.  But, for a good stretch there, that was my life.   <br /><br/>

The funny thing is, if it hadn't been for the health scare that made me a hypochondriac, I am not sure if it would have been as easy to get out of the cycle.  And even saying that, it wasn't easy.  It was very, VERY hard to break the habit... but i read enough articles about people dying from bulimia that I was scared to keep doing it.  I knew I was doing damage to my body, and that I wouldn't be able to keep it up without paying the consequences.  Plus, it made me feel like crap.  I would feel so helpless, depressed, and hopeless after a purge.  I felt like rolling up into a ball and just going to sleep forever.  It's hard to make sense of it to anyone who hasn't been there... I am sure many of you are thinking, "if you know something is going to make you feel like that, then why do you keep doing it?"  It's a valid question that I asked myself many times.  I still don't have a good answer.  I just know that at those moments, I would tell myself this time would be different.  THIS will be the time I can just eat ONE cookie or a LITTLE BIT of the cereal.  I WILL stop by myself this time.  But it would never happen.  I'd eat the package of cookies or the box of cereal in 20 minutes. Then I'd feel fat and ugly and throw it back up. <br /><br/>
At some point, I just made the decision to be done with it.  It was controlling my life.  I wasn't performing as well at work, it was taking a toll on my relationship, and I knew I was stronger than an eating disorder.  It wasn't a cold turkey thing.  I had a couple of hiccups along the way, but made it through.  Just like a recovering drug addict or alcoholic, I still have my moments when it's extremely hard.  I've had thoughts after eating too much that I should just make myself throw up so that I will feel better.  Just like my anxiety, I know that it will be a challenge I'll have to overcome multiple times throughout my life.  <br /><br/>

Around the time I was getting over my bulimia, my boyfriend and I called off our engagement.  We just weren't happy.  I don't think it was either of our faults - I think at the time when we met (both still in college, not really thinking about what we wanted in the future) we were good for each other.  But as we grew up into adults, our lifestyles and goals didn't mesh well.<br /><br/>

Flash forward again to 2015, and now I'm dating someone 16 years older than me who has two teenage children.  I own two houses that I rent out.  I have two dogs that I treat like my children.  I try not to worry too much about "what's going to happen next" in life because you really can't predict it.  If you would have asked me just 3 years ago where I'd be today, I'd tell you I'd be married and maybe even starting a family.  So, you can plan as much as you want, but it likely will turn out completely different.  It's hard for me to do, but I'm trying my best to accept that and let go of being a control freak.<br /><br/>

If you're still reading this, I'm sure you're wondering what all this has to do with my blog.  Well, throughout my entire life, the one thing that has stayed constant is my desire for financial security.  I've never wanted to be rich so I could buy a BMW and a huge house.  But I've always taken money very seriously and always saved as much as I could.  Remember how I said I used to think we were poor growing up?  That's because my Dad is like me.  For people like us, the way we feel secure and OK in this world is knowing that we have enough money to support ourselves and our families.  It's not about what other people (or even our children) think about how much money we make or if we're rich or not.  WE know deep down that we're likely better off than the neighbor who has three cars and a boat because he/she probably took out a bunch of loans to buy that stuff.  You see, in this day and age, I believe it's easier to LOOK rich than actually BE rich and unfortunately, a lot of people get sucked into that trap of easy credit and tying material possessions to their self worth. <br /><br/>

So then why have I struggled so much with being happy and healthy if I have been able to accumulate so much wealth?  I'm not 100% sure yet, but I'm starting to put some of the pieces together.  One of the big reasons that I've come to realize is because I was so focused on doing what I thought everyone else wanted, or expected me to do.  No, I wasn't "fake" because I bought things I couldn't afford.  But yes, I was still fake.  I wanted people at work to think I was really smart and on track to be a "high-up" person in the organization.  So I put SO much into work while ignoring whether or not that was what I truly wanted to do, or if I even liked what I was doing.  It was all about making sure others thought good of me.  I ignored that I wasn't happy in my relationship because I felt like it was what everyone expected of me -- my parents wanted me to be in a stable relationship and all of my friends were starting to get married and have children, so that's what I needed to do, too.  I wanted people to think I was happy, in love, and could do it all.  <br /><br/>

For awhile, I even had myself convinced.  You tell yourself things for too long and you actually start to believe them.  But one day, I just looked around at my life and thought "Wow, I'm really unhappy.  I don't like my job that's paying me $75K/year.  I don't like my big 5 bedroom/4 bath house.  I'm not in love with my boyfriend."  It kind of hit me like a ton of bricks.  I knew I had to make changes, as scary as that might sound.  <br /><br/>

Fast forward to now and I can tell you I'm happy.  Or at least, I'm happy that I'm on a path to becoming happy.  I started this blog because I realized that one of the things that makes me happy in life is helping others.  It makes me smile to feel like I've made an impact on someone's life - like my parents, or my high school teacher did for me.  When I thought about how I could help people, I figured that personal finance would be a good place to start.  But I didn't want my blog to just be about money, as let's be honest, that can get a little dry. <br /><br/>

Eventually, I settled on the idea of being happy, healthy and wealthy.  I could blog about what I know best, but at the same time share my life journey (past and in the future) to hopefully help others who have been through, or are going through similar challenges.  <br /><br/>

So there you have it.  My story up until now.  I hope that you enjoy my blog and more than that, I hope that I can help you in some way, shape or form.  It wasn't an easy choice to share a lot of my personal life with "the world" but the reason I decided to is because I don't want to be thought of as "that perfect" person anymore who can do it all.  Everyone has struggles in their life.  Everyone has been through pain and hurt in some way or another.  It's a good reminder to know that you're never alone or by yourself.  Don't feel ashamed or embarrassed by what has happened in your past - we all make mistakes.  Instead of continuing to try and cover up what you're embarrassed of, make the choice to do better today.  Not tomorrow -- today.<br /><br/>
